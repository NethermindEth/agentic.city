# Agentic.City ðŸŒ†

A monorepo housing experiments and implementations for the Agentic.City framework - a large-scale agent-based system with integrated crypto primitives and multi-platform distribution capabilities.

## Overview

Agentic.City aims to create a robust framework for autonomous agents that can:
- Interact with crypto primitives and blockchain technologies
- Distribute seamlessly across messaging platforms (Telegram, etc.)
- Enable complex agent-to-agent and agent-to-human interactions
- Scale effectively in decentralized environments

### Telegram Bot ðŸ¤–

## Deployment ðŸš€

The Telegram bot is automatically deployed to different environments based on branch merges:

- Production (main branch) -> prod environment
- Staging (staging branch) -> staging environment
- Development (develop branch) -> dev environment

Each environment has its own AWS EC2 instance and configuration. The deployment is handled automatically through GitHub Actions.

### Prerequisites for Deployment

- AWS EC2 instances set up for each environment
- Proper security groups and SSH access configured
- Environment variables set up in GitHub Secrets
- Appropriate AWS IAM roles and permissions
