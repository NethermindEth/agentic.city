# Agentic.City ðŸŒ†

A monorepo housing experiments and implementations for the Agentic.City framework - a large-scale agent-based system with integrated crypto primitives and multi-platform distribution capabilities.

## Overview

Agentic.City aims to create a robust framework for autonomous agents that can:
- Interact with crypto primitives and blockchain technologies
- Distribute seamlessly across messaging platforms (Telegram, etc.)
- Enable complex agent-to-agent and agent-to-human interactions
- Scale effectively in decentralized environments
