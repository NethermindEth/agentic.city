# Contributing to Agentic.City

Welcome to Agentic.City! We're excited about your interest in contributing. This project is designed with AI-first development in mind, and our contribution guidelines reflect this approach.

## Core Principles

1. **AI-Ready Development**: All contributions should be structured with the assumption that they will be processed by AI systems.
2. **Clarity & Precision**: Documentation and code changes must be explicit and unambiguous.
3. **Atomic Changes**: Each contribution should focus on a single feature, fix, or refactor.
4. **Quality Assurance**: All changes must include tests and pass CI/CD checks.

## Creating Issues

Issues are our primary method of tracking work. They must be structured for direct AI consumption:

1. **Clear Objective**: State exactly what needs to be changed or implemented.
2. **Specific Scope**: Define the boundaries of the change.
3. **Implementation Details**: Provide specific technical requirements.
4. **Documentation Updates**: Specify required documentation changes.
5. **Test Requirements**: Outline what tests need to be added or modified.

Vague or ambiguous issues will be closed. We maintain this standard to ensure efficient AI-driven development.

## Pull Requests

When submitting Pull Requests:

1. **Focused Changes**: Each PR should address a single concern.
2. **Comprehensive Description**: Include:
   - The specific problem being solved
   - How the changes address the problem
   - Any technical decisions made
   - Links to related issues
3. **Test Coverage**: Include tests for all new functionality.
4. **CI/CD Compliance**: Ensure all automated checks pass.
5. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation to reflect changes.

## Code Quality Standards

1. **Testing**:
   - All new features must include tests
   - All bug fixes must include regression tests
   - Maintain or improve code coverage

2. **Documentation**:
   - Update API documentation for interface changes
   - Include inline comments for complex logic
   - Update relevant guides and tutorials

3. **Code Style**:
   - Follow the project's established style guide
   - Use meaningful variable and function names
   - Keep functions focused and concise

## Review Process

Multiple AI agents and human reviewers will evaluate contributions for:
1. Correctness
2. Test coverage
3. Documentation quality
4. Code style
5. Performance implications
